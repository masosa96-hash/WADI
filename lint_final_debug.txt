(node:12864) [MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON] Warning: Module type of file:///E:/WADINEW/WADI/eslint.config.js?mtime=1764942077968 is not specified and it doesn't parse as CommonJS.
Reparsing as ES module because module syntax was detected. This incurs a performance overhead.
To eliminate this warning, add "type": "module" to E:\WADINEW\WADI\package.json.
